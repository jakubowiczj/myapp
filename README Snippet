## Running Migrations

### Local Development
1. Ensure your `.env.local` file contains the following variables:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=your_db_name
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   ```

2. Run the migration:
   ```
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

### Production
1. Set the same environment variables in your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
2. Run the migration:
   ```
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

### Auto-updating `updated_at`
The `updated_at` field is set to auto-update on changes using the `onupdate` parameter in the SQLAlchemy model definition.
